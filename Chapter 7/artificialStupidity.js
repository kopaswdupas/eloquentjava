// Having the inhabitants of our world go extinct after a few minutes is kind of depressing. 
// To deal with this, we could try to create a smarter plant eater.

// There are several obvious problems with our herbivores. First, they are terribly greedy, 
// stuffing themselves with every plant they see until they have wiped out the local plant life. 
// Second, their randomized movement (recall that the view.find method returns a random direction 
// when multiple directions match) 
// causes them to stumble around ineffectively and starve if there donâ€™t happen to be any plants nearby. And finally, 
// they breed very fast, which makes the cycles between abundance and famine quite intense.

// Write a new critter type that tries to address one or more of these points and substitute it for 
// the old PlantEater type in the valley world. See how it fares. Tweak it some more if necessary.

The greediness problem can be attacked in several ways. 
The critters could stop eating when they reach a certain energy level. 
Or they could eat only every N turns 
(by keeping a counter of the turns since their last meal in a property on the creature object). 
Or, to make sure plants never go entirely extinct, the animals could refuse to eat a plant unless they see at least 
one other plant nearby (using the findAll method on the view). A combination of these, or some entirely different strategy, 
might also work.

Making the critters move more effectively could be done by stealing one of the movement strategies from the critters 
in our old, energyless world. Both the bouncing behavior and the wall-following behavior showed a much wider range 
of movement than completely random staggering.

Making creatures breed more slowly is trivial. Just increase the minimum energy level at which they reproduce. 
Of course, making the ecosystem more stable also makes it more boring. If you have a handful of fat, 
immobile critters forever munching on a sea of plants and never reproducing, that makes for a very stable ecosystem. 
But no one wants to watch that.
